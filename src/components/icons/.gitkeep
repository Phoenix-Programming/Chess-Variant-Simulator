# The .gitkeep file is a convention used to keep empty directories in git repositories. It has no content and serves only as a placeholder.
# This file should be deleted once the directory contains actual files.

# This directory is intended for storing vue components that represent icons. Each icon can be a separate .vue file, and this directory can be used to organize them.
