# The .gitkeep file is a convention used to keep empty directories in git repositories. It has no content and serves only as a placeholder.
# This file should be deleted once the directory contains actual files.

# This directory is intended for storing typescript unit test files for the components. Each test file can be a separate .spec.ts file, and this directory can be used to organize them.
