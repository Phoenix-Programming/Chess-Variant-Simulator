# Chess-Variant-Simulator

## Overview

Chess-Variant-Simulator is a web application that allows users to create and play custom chess variants. The application provides an intuitive interface for designing new chess games with different board sizes, board shapes, piece movements, win conditions, and other gameplay mechanics, then lets you play those variants with full rule validation.

## Set Up

1. Open up a terminal (or cd into) the project's root folder
2. Install all npm dependencies with `npm install --include=dev`
3. Run the project on a local web server for development with the `npm run dev` command

### Key Directories

- **`src/shared/`** – Contains game logic that runs on both client and server, including board management, piece behavior, and move validation
- **`src/server/`** – Express.js backend for handling multiplayer games and game state persistence
- **`src/assets/scripts/`** – Client-side code for user interface and local game management
- **`tests/`** – Unit tests that mirror the source code structure for easy navigation

## Commands

1. Build the project for production with the `npm run build` command
2. Run the project on a local web server for development with the `npm run dev` command
3. Run the project build on a local web server with the `npm run preview` command
4. Check and fix code quality issues with the `npm run lint` command
5. Run the Express API with the `npm run start` command
6. Execute the project's unit tests with the `npm run test` command, or simply `npm test`
7. Execute the unit tests in watch mode with the `npm run test:watch` command
8. See the project's test coverage with the `npm run coverage` command
9. See the project's test coverage in watch mode with the `npm run coverage:watch` command
